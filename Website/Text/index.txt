"A full web service that enables a GP or NHS clinic to host a virtual queue waiting system. This is activated by a Twilio SMS message and forwards you to a virtual queue. Receptionists can view everyone in the queue at once and see descriptions of the patients problems which have been given while they are waiting in the queue. The receptionist can then forward them on with links to resources or links to talk to other members of staff. The patient can see how many people are in the queue ahead of them hopefully reducing their frustration at having to wait. "

The system we have created utilises an Azure based Django server for the callers and a java client for the receptionists. The callers initially are presented with a html page (served by the Django server) and can input their name, date of birth etc for the receptionists use. They are then moved into a queue where they can enter a description to be shown to the receptionist. The receptionist will be shown a screen of the callers in the queue as well as the data the caller has provided. They can then send links to the callers accord to what is most appropriate - this will then redirect the caller to a screen with this link for them to click.

This system allows for a greater degree of efficiency for receptionists and should reduce caller time in the queue while improving their caller experience. This is because the receptionists does not need to talk to every caller in a linear fashion. If someone can just be forwarded onto another member of staff or a self referral form etc then they can be, this will mean some callers can be processed much faster. This will reduce wait times for callers therefore making the experience far better.
