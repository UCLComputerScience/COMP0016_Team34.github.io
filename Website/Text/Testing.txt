<h1><b>Testing</b></h1>

We testing the system in various ways to ensure system stability and robustness

<h2><b>Manual Testing</b></h2>
<br>
Manual testing was used throughout the development of the system in order to identify both visible and hidden defects in system. At each stage of development (caller ui design, server side data reception, receptionist ui design etc.) we made sure tested using temporary variables to model the system as if it were really being used.

<h2><b>Django Test</b></h2>
<br>
The Django was tested using cURL

These commands were used to send data to the server to ensure the format is suitable for the server - this means it doesn't matter how data is sent by the client.

<h2><b>Client testing</b></h2>
<br>
We asked our clients to also test the system during a live demo so they could see first-hand what the system was capable of, as well as being able to receive feedback on the system features. This was useful to identify what features they still wanted, but also to see how the system was perceived by people outside of the development team, which is important.
