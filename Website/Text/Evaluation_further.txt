<h1><b>Further improvements</b></h1>

The project has achieved most of the features required by the clients, however it could be improved in the following aspects:

<h1><b>Caller feedback mechanism</b></h1>

Once the caller finishes their call, there is no way for the caller to provide feedback on the qaulity of the call - i.e. Was their query answered? Do still need to speak to someone? In the future, it would be useful to provide a method for callers to provide feedback on the practice. Additionally, there can be a way for callers to receive a practice number to call after they have used the system, to talk to someone if they still require help.

<h1><b>Use online database to store caller records</b></h1>

The current project stores all the caller records in a txt file, as we are NOT provided with any online NHS database to store the caller data. It would be more secure and efficient to store all caller records in a database - specifically, access to the NHS' FIHR database would allow all patient records to be consitent and centralised.

<h1><b>Caller list</b></h1>

It would be useful for practices to keep a log of callers that have used the system so that patients that require extra time and more personal input can be contacted
<br>
This can also be used for when the system is offline (e.g. over weekends) so that receptionists can see a list of callers that they would need to attend to once the system is back online.
