<h1><b>Further improvements</b></h1>
The project has achieved most of the features required by the clients, however it could be improved in the following aspects:
<h1><b>Caller feedback mechanism</b></h1>
In the existing calling system, after the caller clicks the link sent by receptionist, the life cycle of this caller is ended. This means if the caller is unsatisfied with the link sent, or requires further support after having an online conversation, he cannot do that within our system. What could be achieved, is: After the user clicks the link, the browser opens a new webpage for the link he clicked whilst keeps this caller in the system. Then there is a feedback page, if he is unsatisfied with the result, he should be added to the top of the queue and need to be handled again in a more proper way.

<h1><b>Use online database to store caller records</b></h1>
The current project stores all the caller records in a txt file, as we are NOT provided with any online NHS database to store the caller data. It would be more secure and efficient to store all caller records in a database.
